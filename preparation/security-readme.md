# Security - Technical interview questions & answers
1. DDoS - A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic
2. IDS & IPS - Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors network traffic and sends an alert to the user when it identifies suspicious traffic. After receiving the alert the user can take action to find the root cause and remedy it. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a software platform that analyses network traffic content to detect and respond to exploits. The IPS sits behind the firewall and uses anomaly detection or signature-based detection to identify network threats. These solutions also come with automated responses such as blocking the traffic source address, dropping malicious packets, and sending alerts to the user.
